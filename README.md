# Othello-with-predictive-analysis
Modification of the classic game of Othello with min-max predictive analysis


## Project Description:

Since Othello is a perfect information game, an Othello-playing AI should be able to predict the future moves that players will play via various search and evaluation algorithms. One such example of a decision algorithm used by AI systems is the Minimax approach. Minimaxing is a method used when evaluating a game’s decision tree to ensure that the move chosen by the player maximises the chance of a favorable outcome for them. In a game of Othello, a minimax evaluation on the game tree would favour a move that increases the player’s score by three over a move that would only increase the score by one, due to the larger perceived gain. However, the minimax algorithm also evaluates the opponent’s moves, which assumes that the opponent will always pick the move that minimises the player’s gain from a move. As a result, the algorithm reflects the best outcome for the player should they choose that branch of the game tree.
